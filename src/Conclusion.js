        Walkable cities have immense value as a climate change solution, as it
        works to eliminate car-based emissions, while also improving the health
        and communities of thousands. By investing in and switching to walkable
        city infrastructure, we not only take a large step in reducing the
        impact of climate change but also make general strides to help improve
        the lives of many.
